NB: I did not work on the repository from the start, and that is my mistake, now I only have one commit. Apologies.

# Navbar Section
I created a totally different Navbar from the original design, and it has navlinks, and when the user is in a certain page, the nav item will do an animation just to show that you are in that page. It accommodates different screen sizes.

# Carousel Section
I avoided using cards as the original design, so I decided to do a carousal, that yhe user will have to navigate to show each and every detail of an item. I created a button that will take you to see the details of the selected page. It also accommodates different screen sizes. 

# Modal Section
The button from the carousel takes you to the modal where more information is provided of the selected item. Now it is up to the user if they feel like that is what they want, and they will select it. Also it accommodates different screen sizes.
When the select button is clicked in the modal, popup shows to let the user know that they have selected the item, and they cannot select it again.
